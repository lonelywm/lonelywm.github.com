<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) established the new Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specification on May 26, 2002. In this article I will provide a working implementation of AES written in C#, and a complete explanation of exactly what AES is and how the code works. I’ll show you how to encrypt data using AES and extend the code given here to develop a commercial-quality AES class. I’ll also explain how and why to incorporate AES encryption into your software systems, and how to test AES-based software.</p>
<p>Note that the code presented in this article and any other implementation based on this article is subject to applicable Federal cryptographic module export controls (see Commercial Encryption Export Controls for the exact regulations).</p>

<p>AES is a new cryptographic algorithm that can be used to protect electronic data. Specifically, AES is an iterative, symmetric-key block cipher that can use keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits, and encrypts and decrypts data in blocks of 128 bits (16 bytes). Unlike public-key ciphers, which use a pair of keys, symmetric-key ciphers use the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. Encrypted data returned by block ciphers have the same number of bits that the input data had. Iterative ciphers use a loop structure that repeatedly performs permutations and substitutions of the input data. Figure 1 shows AES in action encrypting and then decrypting a 16-byte block of data using a 192-bit key.</p>
<p><img src="../Principle-and-implementation-of-AES/1.gif" alt=""><br><em>Figure 1 Some Data</em></p>
<p>AES is the successor to the older Data Encryption Standard (DES). DES was approved as a Federal standard in 1977 and remained viable until 1998 when a combination of advances in hardware, software, and cryptanalysis theory allowed a DES-encrypted message to be decrypted in 56 hours. Since that time numerous other successful attacks on DES-encrypted data have been made and DES is now considered past its useful lifetime.</p>
<p>In late 1999, the Rijndael (pronounced “rain doll”) algorithm, created by researchers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, was selected by the NIST as the proposal that best met the design criteria of security, implementation efficiency, versatility, and simplicity. Although the terms AES and Rijndael are sometimes used interchangeably, they are distinct. AES is widely expected to become the de facto standard for encrypting all forms of electronic data including data used in commercial applications such as banking and financial transactions, telecommunications, and private and Federal information.</p>
<h2 id="Overview_of_the_AES_Algorithm">Overview of the AES Algorithm</h2><p>The AES algorithm is based on permutations and substitutions. Permutations are rearrangements of data, and substitutions replace one unit of data with another. AES performs permutations and substitutions using several different techniques. To illustrate these techniques, let’s walk through a concrete example of AES encryption using the data shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>The following is the 128-bit value that you will encrypt with the indexes array: </p>
<pre><code><span class="number">00</span> <span class="number">11</span> <span class="number">22</span> <span class="number">33</span> <span class="number">44</span> <span class="number">55</span> <span class="number">66</span> <span class="number">77</span> <span class="number">88</span> <span class="number">99</span> aa bb cc dd ee ff

</code></pre><p><img src="../Principle-and-implementation-of-AES/2.gif" alt=""><br><em>Figure 2 Sbox</em></p>
<p>Figure 2 SboxWhen the AES constructor is called, two tables that will be used by the encryption method are initialized. The first table is a substitution box named Sbox. It is a 16 × 16 matrix. The first five rows and columns of Sbox are shown in Figure 2. Behind the scenes, the encryption routine takes the key array and uses it to generate a “key schedule” table named w[], shown in Figure 3.</p>
<p><img src="../Principle-and-implementation-of-AES/3.gif" alt=""><br><em>Figure 3 Key Sched.</em></p>
<p>Figure 3 Key Sched.The first Nk (6) rows of w[] are seeded with the original key value (0x00 through 0x17) and the remaining rows are generated from the seed key. The variable Nk represents the size of the seed key in 32-bit words. You’ll see exactly how w[] is generated later when I examine the AES implementation. The point is that there are now many keys to use instead of just one. These new keys are called the round keys to distinguish them from the original seed key.</p>

<p>Figure 4 StateThe AES encryption routine begins by copying the 16-byte input array into a 4×4 byte matrix named State (see Figure 4). The AES encryption algorithm is named Cipher and operates on State[] and can be described in pseudocode (see Figure 5).</p>

<p><em>Figure 5 Cipher Algorithm Pseudocode</em></p>
<p>The encryption algorithm performs a preliminary processing step that’s called AddRoundKey in the specification. AddRoundKey performs a byte-by-byte XOR operation on the State matrix using the first four rows of the key schedule, and XORs input State[r,c] with round keys table w[c,r].</p>
<p>For example, if the first row of the State matrix holds the bytes { 00, 44, 88, cc }, and the first column of the key schedule is { 00, 04, 08, 0c }, then the new value of State[0,2] is the result of XORing State[0,2] (0x88) with w[2,0] (0x08), or 0x80: </p>
<pre><code><span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="number">0</span>

</code></pre><p>The main loop of the AES encryption algorithm performs four different operations on the State matrix, called SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey in the specification. The AddRoundKey operation is the same as the preliminary AddRoundKey except that each time AddRoundKey is called, the next four rows of the key schedule are used. The SubBytes routine is a substitution operation that takes each byte in the State matrix and substitutes a new byte determined by the Sbox table. For example, if the value of State[0,1] is 0x40 and you want to find its substitute, you take the value at State[0,1] (0x40) and let x equal the left digit (4) and y equal the right digit (0). Then you use x and y as indexes into the Sbox table to find the substitution value, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p>ShiftRows is a permutation operation that rotates bytes in the State matrix to the left. Figure 6 shows how ShiftRows works on State[]. Row 0 of State is rotated 0 positions to the left, row 1 is rotated 1 position left, row 2 is rotated 2 positions left, and row 3 is rotated 3 positions left.</p>
<p><img src="../Principle-and-implementation-of-AES/5.gif" alt=""><br><em>Figure 6 Running ShiftRows on State</em></p>
<p>Figure 6 Running ShiftRows on StateThe MixColumns operation is a substitution operation that is the trickiest part of the AES algorithm to understand. It replaces each byte with the result of mathematical field additions and multiplications of values in the byte’s column. I will explain the details of special field addition and multiplication in the next section.</p>
<p>Suppose the value at State[0,1] is 0x09, and the other values in column 1 are 0x60, 0xe1, and 0x04; then the new value for State[0,1] is shown in the following: </p>

<p>The addition and multiplication are special mathematical field operations, not the usual addition and multiplication on integers.</p>
<p>The four operations SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey are called inside a loop that executes Nr times—the number of rounds for a given key size, less 1. The number of rounds that the encryption algorithm uses is either 10, 12, or 14 and depends on whether the seed key size is 128, 192, or 256 bits. In this example, because Nr equals 12, the four operations are called 11 times. After this iteration completes, the encryption algorithm finishes by calling SubBytes, ShiftRows, and AddRoundKey before copying the State matrix to the output parameter.</p>
<p>In summary, there are four operations that are at the heart of the AES encryption algorithm. AddRoundKey substitutes groups of 4 bytes using round keys generated from the seed key value. SubBytes substitutes individual bytes using a substitution table. ShiftRows permutes groups of 4 bytes by rotating 4-byte rows. MixColumns substitutes bytes using a combination of both field addition and multiplication.</p>
<h2 id="Field_Addition_and_Multiplication_in_GF(28)">Field Addition and Multiplication in GF(28)</h2><p>As you’ve seen, the AES encryption algorithm uses fairly straightforward techniques for substitution and permutation, except for the MixColumns routine. The MixColumns routine uses special addition and multiplication. The addition and multiplication used by AES are based on mathematical field theory. In particular, AES is based on a field called GF(28).</p>
<p>The GF(28) field consists of a set of 256 values from 0x00 to 0xff, plus addition and multiplication, hence the (28). GF stands for Galois Field, named after the mathematician who founded field theory. One of the characteristics of GF(28) is that the result of an addition or multiplication operation must be in the set {0x00 … 0xff}. Although the theory of fields is rather deep, the net result for GF(28) addition is simple: GF(28) addition is just the XOR operation.</p>
<p>Multiplication in GF(28) is trickier, however. As you’ll see later in the C# implementation, the AES encryption and decryption routines need to know how to multiply by only the seven constants 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x09, 0x0b, 0x0d, and 0x0e. So instead of explaining GF(28) multiplication theory in general, I will explain it just for these seven specific cases.</p>
<p>Multiplication by 0x01 in GF(28) is special; it corresponds to multiplication by 1 in normal arithmetic and works the same way—any value times 0x01 equals itself.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at multiplication by 0x02. As in the case of addition, the theory is deep, but the net result is fairly simple. If the value being multiplied is less than 0x80, then the result of multiplication is just the value left-shifted 1 bit position. If the value being multiplied is greater than or equal to 0x80, then the result of multiplication is the value left-shifted 1 bit position XORed with the value 0x1b. This prevents “field overflow” and keeps the product of the multiplication in range.</p>
<p>Once you’ve established addition and multiplication by 0x02 in GF(28), you can use them to define multiplication by any constant. To multiply by 0x03 in GF(28), you can decompose 0x03 as powers of 2 and additions. To multiply an arbitrary byte b by 0x03, observe that 0x03 = 0x02 + 0x01. Thus: </p>
<figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">b * <span class="number">0x03</span> = b * (<span class="number">0x02</span> + <span class="number">0x01</span>)</span><br><span class="line">         = (b * <span class="number">0x02</span>) + (b * <span class="number">0x01</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>This can be done because you know how to multiply by 0x02 and 0x01 and how to perform addition. Similarly, to multiply an arbitrary byte b by 0x0d, you do this:<br><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">b * <span class="number">0x0d</span> = b * (<span class="number">0x08</span> + <span class="number">0x04</span> + <span class="number">0x01</span>)</span><br><span class="line">         = (b * <span class="number">0x08</span>) + (b * <span class="number">0x04</span>) + (b * <span class="number">0x01</span>)</span><br><span class="line">         = (b * <span class="number">0x02</span> * <span class="number">0x02</span> * <span class="number">0x02</span>) + (b * <span class="number">0x02</span> * <span class="number">0x02</span>) + (b * <span class="number">0x01</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>The other multiplications needed for the AES MixColumns routine in the encryption and decryption algorithm follow the same general pattern, as shown here: </p>
<figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">b * <span class="number">0x09</span> = b * (<span class="number">0x08</span> + <span class="number">0x01</span>)</span><br><span class="line">         = (b * <span class="number">0x02</span> * <span class="number">0x02</span> * <span class="number">0x02</span>) + (b * <span class="number">0x01</span>)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">b * <span class="number">0x0b</span> = b * (<span class="number">0x08</span> + <span class="number">0x02</span> + <span class="number">0x01</span>)</span><br><span class="line">         = (b * <span class="number">0x02</span> * <span class="number">0x02</span> * <span class="number">0x02</span>) + (b * <span class="number">0x02</span>) + (b * <span class="number">0x01</span>)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">b * <span class="number">0x0e</span> = b * (<span class="number">0x08</span> + <span class="number">0x04</span> + <span class="number">0x02</span>)</span><br><span class="line">         = (b * <span class="number">0x02</span> * <span class="number">0x02</span> * <span class="number">0x02</span>) + (b * <span class="number">0x02</span> * <span class="number">0x02</span>) + (b * <span class="number">0x02</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>To summarize, addition in GF(28) is the XOR operation. Multiplication in GF(28) reduces to additions and multiplications by 0x02, where multiplication by 0x02 is a conditional 1-bit left shift. The AES specification contains a lot of additional information about operations in GF(28).</p>
<h2 id="Key_Expansion">Key Expansion</h2><p>The AES encryption and decryption algorithms use a key schedule generated from the seed key array of bytes. The AES specification refers to this as the KeyExpansion routine. Generating, in essence, multiple keys from an initial key instead of using a single key greatly increases the diffusion of bits. Although not overwhelmingly difficult, understanding KeyExpansion is one of the trickier parts of the AES algorithm. In high-level pseudocode, the KeyExpansion routine looks like the following: </p>
<figure class="highlight livecodeserver"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">KeyExpansion(<span class="keyword">byte</span>[] key, <span class="keyword">byte</span>[][<span class="number">4</span>] w)</span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  copy <span class="operator">the</span> seed key <span class="keyword">into</span> <span class="operator">the</span> <span class="keyword">first</span> rows <span class="operator">of</span> w</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="keyword">each</span> remaining row <span class="operator">of</span> w</span><br><span class="line">  &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    use <span class="constant">two</span> <span class="operator">of</span> <span class="operator">the</span> previous rows <span class="built_in">to</span> <span class="built_in">create</span> <span class="operator">a</span> <span class="built_in">new</span> row</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The “use two of the previous rows to create a new row” routine makes use of two subroutines, RotWord and SubWord, and a table of constants named Rcon (for “round constants”). Let’s look at each of these three items and then come back to the KeyExpansion routine as a whole.</p>
<p>The RotWord routine is simple. It accepts an array of 4 bytes and rotates them 1 position left. Because the round schedule table w[] has four columns, RotWord rotates a row of w[] to the left. Notice that the RotWord function used by KeyExpansion is very similar to the ShiftRows routine used by the encryption algorithm except that it works on a single row of the key schedule w[] instead of the entire encryption state table State[].</p>
<p>The SubWord routine performs a byte-by-byte substitution on a given row of the key schedule table w[] using the substitution table Sbox. The substitutions in KeyExpansion operate exactly like those in the encryption algorithm. The input byte to be substituted is separated into an (x,y) pair which are used as indexes into the substitution table Sbox. For example, substitution for 0x27 results in x = 2 and y = 7, and Sbox[2,7] returns 0xcc.</p>
<p>The KeyExpansion routine uses an array Rcon[], called the round constant table. These constants are 4 bytes each to match with a row of the key schedule table. The AES KeyExpansion routine requires 11 round constants. You can see these constants listed in Figure 7.</p>

<p>The leftmost byte of each round constant is a power of 2 in the GF(28) field. Another way of looking at it is to observe that each value is the previous value times 0x02, as described in the previous section discussing multiplication in GF(28). Notice that 0x80 × 0x02 = 0x1b is 0x80 left-shifted 1 bit followed by an XOR with 0x1b, as described earlier.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a closer look at the loop inside KeyExpansion. In more detailed pseudocode than before, the loop is: </p>

<p>Ignoring the if clause for a moment, you’ll see that each row of the key schedule table w[] is the result of XORing the previous row with the row Nk (4, 6, or 8 depending on the key size) rows before. The first part of the if conditional modifies every fourth, sixth, or eighth row of the key schedule with SubWord, RotWord, and XORing with a round constant, depending on whether the key size is 128, 192, or 256 bits. The second part of the conditional will modify rows 12, 20, 28 and so on—every eighth row—for a 256-bit key to add additional variability to the key schedule.</p>
<p>Let’s see how KeyExpansion gets started with the example presented at the beginning of this article. The seed key is the 192-bit / 6-word value: </p>
<figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="number">00</span> <span class="number">01</span> <span class="number">02</span> <span class="number">03</span> <span class="number">04</span> <span class="number">05</span> <span class="number">06</span> <span class="number">07</span> <span class="number">08</span> <span class="number">09</span> <span class="number">0</span>a <span class="number">0</span>b <span class="number">0</span>c <span class="number">0</span>d <span class="number">0</span>e <span class="number">0f</span> <span class="number">10</span> <span class="number">11</span> <span class="number">12</span> <span class="number">13</span> <span class="number">14</span> <span class="number">15</span> <span class="number">16</span> <span class="number">17</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The key schedule byte table w[] has the dimensions 4 columns and Nb × (Nr + 1) equals 4 × (12 + 1), or 52 rows. The KeyExpansion routine copies the values in the seed key into the first rows of the key schedule byte table w[]. Because my seed key is 192 bits (24 bytes), and the w[] table always has 4 columns, in this case KeyExapansion copies the seed key into the first 6 rows of w[]. Now let’s see how the KeyExpansion routine fills the rest of the key schedule table. In my example, the first calculated row is row 6 because rows 0 to 5 were filled with the seed key values: </p>

<p>To summarize, an important part of AES encryption and decryption is the generation of multiple round keys from the initial seed key. This KeyExpansion algorithm generates a key schedule and uses substitution and permutation in a way that is similar in most respects to the encryption and decryption algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="The_AES_Class_Constructor_in_C">The AES Class Constructor in C</h2><p>Now that I’ve examined all the components of the AES encryption algorithm, I’ll implement it in C#. The official specification of the AES algorithm is contained in Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 197. I decided to base my implementation on it as closely as possible, but I quickly discovered that the specification was more of a theory document than an implementation guide. To exploit the official specification as a resource, I have used the same variable names as those used in the standards publication (even when they are rather cryptic like “Nr” and “w”).</p>
<p>My design uses the nine data members and one enumeration type as shown here: </p>
<figure class="highlight groovy"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">enum</span> <span class="title">KeySize</span> &#123;</span> Bits128, Bits192, </span><br><span class="line">                      Bits256 &#125;;  </span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="typename">int</span> Nb;         </span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="typename">int</span> Nk;         </span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="typename">int</span> Nr;         </span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="typename">byte</span>[] key;     </span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="typename">byte</span>[,] Sbox;   </span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="typename">byte</span>[,] iSbox;  </span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="typename">byte</span>[,] w;       </span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="typename">byte</span>[,] Rcon;   </span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="typename">byte</span>[,] State;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Because the key size can only be 128, 192, or 256 bits, it is a great candidate for an enumerated type: </p>
<figure class="highlight crystal"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">public <span class="class"><span class="keyword">enum</span> <span class="title">KeySize</span> &#123; <span class="title">Bits128</span>, <span class="title">Bits192</span>, <span class="title">Bits256</span> &#125;;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The specification document generally uses bytes as its basic storage unit but uses 4-byte words as the size for two important data members. The two members Nb and Nk represent the block size in words and key size in words, respectively. Nr represents the number of rounds. The block size is always 16 bytes (or 128 bits, which is 4 words for AES), so it could have been declared as a constant. The key size is assigned a value of 4, 6, or 8 according to the value of the enumeration parameter KeySize. The AES algorithm iterates through a number of rounds to increase the complexity of the encrypted data. The number of rounds is either 10, 12, or 14 and is based on cryptanalysis theory. It depends directly on the key size.</p>
<p>When designing a class interface, I like to work backwards. I imagine calling the constructor and methods from an application. Using this approach, I decided that I wanted to instantiate an AES object like the following: </p>
<figure class="highlight stylus"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Aes <span class="tag">a</span> = new <span class="function"><span class="title">Aes</span><span class="params">(the key size, the seed key)</span></span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>I called the encryption and decryption routines as follows:<br><figure class="highlight autohotkey"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="literal">a</span>.Cipher(plainText, cipherText)<span class="comment">;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="literal">a</span>.InvCipher(cipherText, decipheredText)<span class="comment">;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>I chose the slightly awkward method names Cipher and InvCipher because they are used in the AES specification document. Here is the code for the AES class constructor: </p>
<figure class="highlight processing"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> Aes(KeySize keySize, <span class="built_in">byte</span>[] keyBytes)</span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  SetNbNkNr(keySize);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">this</span>.<span class="variable">key</span> = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="built_in">byte</span>[<span class="keyword">this</span>.Nk * <span class="number">4</span>];  </span><br><span class="line">  keyBytes.CopyTo(<span class="keyword">this</span>.<span class="variable">key</span>, <span class="number">0</span>);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  BuildSbox();</span><br><span class="line">  BuildInvSbox();</span><br><span class="line">  BuildRcon();</span><br><span class="line">  KeyExpansion();  </span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The constructor first set the values of Nb, Nk, and Nr by calling a helper method SetNbNkNr, which is shown in Figure 8. If efficiency is a concern, you could put this code directly in the constructor to avoid the overhead of a method call.</p>

<p><em>Figure 8 SetNbNkNr Method  (Close Figure 8)</em></p>
<p>Next, you have to copy the bytes that are passed into the constructor into the class field variable. The key is declared with the other class fields and it gets its value by doing this:</p>
<figure class="highlight processing"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">this</span>.<span class="variable">key</span> = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="built_in">byte</span>[<span class="keyword">this</span>.Nk * <span class="number">4</span>];  </span><br><span class="line">keyBytes.CopyTo(<span class="keyword">this</span>.<span class="variable">key</span>, <span class="number">0</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>I decided to call the initialization of the substitution tables Sbox[] and iSbox[] using the private helper methods BuildSbox and BuildInvSbox in the constructor. Now Sbox[] and iSbox[] are required by the key expansion routine and the Cipher and InvCipher methods, respectively, so I could have put initialization of Sbox[] and invocation of the KeyExpansion method in both the Cipher and the InvCipher methods, but putting them in the constructor results in a cleaner code structure. sBox[] gets populated in Figure 9. The code that populates iSbox[] is similar. The code is structured for readability. As you’ll see later, there is a surprising alternative to this way of supplying values for the Sbox and iSbox tables.</p>

<p>Declaring the key schedule table w[], the round constants table Rcon[] and the state matrix State[] in the constructor, and assigning values to Rcon[] and w[] with private helper methods seems to me to be the best way to organize them, but that is mostly a matter of style. The code that populates the round constant table Rcon is shown in Figure 7.</p>
<p>Recall that the left byte of each row of Rcon[] is a power of 2 in GF(28) so this table could be built computationally using something like the following: </p>

<p>The AES constructor finishes by building the key schedule table w[] which is done in the KeyExpansion method (see Figure 10). The code is fairly straightforward. The specification document uses a hypothetical 4-byte word data type. Since C# has no such type, it is simulated with an array of 4 bytes. After the key schedule w[] is allocated space using the operator new, the first Nk (4, 6, or 8) rows of w[] get values from the seed key[] array that was passed into the constructor: </p>

<p><em>Figure 10 KeyExpansion Method (Close Figure 10)</em></p>
<p>The operation of XORing 2 bytes together happens a lot in this code. It requires some casting from byte to int and back to byte because the XOR operator ^ is not defined on the C# byte type. For example </p>
<figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">temp[<span class="number">0</span>] = (byte)( (<span class="keyword">int</span>)temp[<span class="number">0</span>] ^ (<span class="keyword">int</span>)<span class="keyword">this</span>.Rcon[row/Nk,<span class="number">0</span>] );</span><br><span class="line">is used instead of: </span><br><span class="line">temp[<span class="number">0</span>] = temp[<span class="number">0</span>] ^ <span class="keyword">this</span>.Rcon[row/Nk,<span class="number">0</span>];</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The KeyExpansion method conditionally calls the private methods SubWord and RotWord to maintain naming consistency with the specification. Again, because there is no word type in C#, I implemented one using an array of 4 bytes. The code for SubWord and RotWord is fairly simple and you should be able to understand it easily by examining it in the AesLib source code that accompanies this article.</p>
<p>The slightly tricky part is looking up the substitution values in SubWord. Recall that to find the substitute value, you separate the input byte into its leftmost 4 bits and its rightmost 4 bits. For a given byte, right-shifting 4 bits with the &gt;&gt; operator will yield the x index, and logical ANDing with 0000 1111 will yield the y value. In slightly longer, but more readable form than the actual code, I could have done something like the following </p>

<p>To summarize, the AES constructor accepts a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits and a byte array seed key value. The constructor assigns values for the input block size, the seed key size, and the number of rounds for the encryption algorithm and copies the seed key to a data member named key. The constructor also builds four tables: two substitution tables used by the encryption and decryption methods, a table of round constants, and a key schedule of round keys.</p>

<p>The Cipher method starts by copying the plaintext input array to the state matrix State[]. After an initial call to AddRoundKey, the Cipher method iterates one time fewer than the total number of rounds. On the last round, the call to MixColumns is omitted as described in the specification.</p>
<p>The code for the AddRoundKey and SubBytes private methods is shown in Figure 12. The AddRoundKey method needs to know what round it is at so that it can reference the correct four rows of the key schedule array w[]. Notice that State[r,c] is XORed with w[c,r] and not w[r,c]. The SubBytes method extracts indexes from the input byte using the same right-shift-4-bits and mask-with-0x0f technique used in the KeyExpansion method.</p>

<p>These expressions are a bit long already so I decided to write private helper functions that return the product of GF(28) multiplication by 0x01, 0x02, and 0x03. The helper functions are very short. For example, the code that’s used to field-multiply a byte b by 0x03 is as follows:<br><figure class="highlight lisp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">return <span class="list">(<span class="keyword">byte</span>)</span> <span class="list">( <span class="list">(<span class="keyword">int</span>)</span>gfmultby02<span class="list">(<span class="keyword">b</span>)</span> ^ <span class="list">(<span class="keyword">int</span>)</span>b )</span><span class="comment">;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>As I discussed earlier, multiplication by 0x02 is the essential operation for all GF(28) multiplication. I called my gfmultby02 method, bending my convention of using the same method names that have been used in the specification; the specification calls this routine xtime.</p>
<p>The Cipher method iteratively applies four operations on its input to produce encrypted output. AddRoundKey substitutes bytes using multiple round keys derived from the single original seed key. SubBytes substitutes bytes using values in a substitution table. ShiftRows permutes bytes by shifting rows of bytes, and MixColumns substitutes bytes using field addition and multiplication of values in a column.</p>
<h3 id="The_AES_InvCipher_Method_in_C">The AES InvCipher Method in C</h3><p>The basic premise behind the AES decipher algorithm is simple: to decrypt an encrypted block, just undo every operation in the reverse order. Although this is the basic concept, there are a few details to handle.</p>
<p>The AES specification names the decipher routine InvCipher rather than alternatives Decipher or Decrypt. This is a reflection of the mathematics behind AES, which are based in terms of inverse mathematical operations.</p>
<p>If you compare this code with the Cipher code, you will see that it is pretty much what you might expect, but with two exceptions. First, the order of the inverse method calls (like InvSubBytes) in the InvCipher method is not exactly the reverse of the corresponding calls (like SubBytes) in the Cipher method, and second, InvCipher calls the AddRoundKey method instead of an InvAddRoundKey method. Notice that the InvCipher algorithm uses the key schedule table but starts at the higher-numbered indexes and works its way down to row 0.</p>
<p>The code for the InvSubBytes, InvShiftRows, and InvMixColumns methods closely mirrors the code for the related SubBytes, ShiftRows, and MixColumns methods. The InvSubBytes method is just like the SubBytes method except that it uses the inverse substitution table iSbox[] instead of the Sbox[] table.</p>
<p>As you might guess, iSbox[] just undoes any mapping performed by Sbox[]. For example, if you have byte b that equals 0x20 and find its substitution value in Sbox[], you get 0xb7. If you look up the substitution value for 0xb7 in iSbox[], you get 0x20.</p>
<p>Similarly the InvShiftRows method undoes the ShiftRows method—row[0] is shifted 0 positions to the right, row[1] is shifted 1 position right, row[2] is shifted 2 positions right, and row[3] is shifted 3 positions right.</p>
<p>The InvMixColumns method undoes the work of MixColumns, but not in an obvious way. Recall that MixColumns replaces each byte in the state matrix with a linear combination of bytes in the original byte’s column and that the coefficients were 0x01, 0x02, and 0x03. Once again, field theory comes into play. It turns out that the inverse operation is similar but uses multiplication by 0x09, 0x0b, 0x0d, and 0x0e like this: </p>

<p>As with the MixColumns method, I decided to write dedicated helper functions rather than expand the already long expressions inline or write a general multiplication helper function. Let me show you how I wrote the function that multiplies any byte, b, by the constant 0x0e (14 in base 10). The number 14, like any number, can be expressed as the sum of powers of 2. In this case, 14 equals 2 + 4 + 8. And since 4 equals 2 squared and 8 equals 2 cubed, you can express 14 as 2 + 22 + 23. Remember that addition is just XOR (^) in GF(28) and since I already have the gfmultby02 function, I can use it to get my result: </p>

<p>All of the operations used by the AES encryption algorithm are invertible, so the decryption algorithm essentially reverses all the operations performed by encryption.</p>
<h3 id="Using_the_AES_Class">Using the AES Class</h3><p>One of the features of AES as implemented in C# is its simplicity. Consider the code in Figure 15 that I used to generate the output shown in Figure 1. After declaring hardcoded values for the 16-byte plaintext input and the 24-byte (192-bit) seed key, an AES object is initialized, the encrypting Cipher method encrypts the plaintext to cipher text, and then the cipher text is decrypted back using InvCipher. Very clean and simple.</p>

<p>Because an AES object works on byte arrays, you can easily adapt it to work on other .NET data types. I constructed a little Windows®-based demo app that accepts a single 8-character (16-byte) string and then encrypts and decrypts it. A sample run is shown in Figure 16.</p>
<p>Figure 16 Encryption Demo</p>
<p>Because both the encryption and decryption routines need to know what key size the user has specified, I declared it as a class-scope variable, like this: </p>
<p>private Aes.KeySize keysize;<br>Notice that the seed key is not specified by the user. The demo uses a “null key” which consists of all zero bytes by supplying a dummy new byte[16] to the constructor. The size of the dummy argument is irrelevant because the seed key will also be initialized to all zeros. Null key encryption and decryption is an easy and effective way to deter casual external examination of your data. The Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes and Encoding.Unicode.GetString methods in System.Text make it very easy to convert a .NET string to a byte array, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Implementation Alternatives<br>Now let’s look at some important variations of the AES implementation presented in this article, possible extensions of the code presented here, and cryptanalysis attacks against AES.</p>
<p>As much as any code that I’ve ever worked on, the AES algorithm has significant alternative approaches to implementation. Why is this important? AES is intended to be applicable to a wide range of systems, from smart cards with tiny memory capacities to large multiprocessor mainframe systems. In many scenarios, performance is critical and sometimes memory or processing resources are limited. Virtually every routine in AES can be modified to optimize performance at the expense of memory, or vice versa. For example, assigning the 256 values to the substitution table Sbox[] seems straightforward enough. However, these values are based on GF(28) theory and it turns out that these values can be generated programmatically. The same is true for the inverse substitution table and the round constants table.</p>
<p>Another interesting possibility for alternate implementation is the GF(28) multiplication used by the Cipher and InvCipher methods. My implementation codes a basic function that multiplies by 0x02 and then six additional functions which call gfmultby02. Another possibility would be to write a general multiplication function and use it instead of implementing seven separate functions like I did. At another extreme you could use a complete table of the product of all 256 possible byte values multiplied by 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x09, 0x0b, 0x0d, and 0x0e. Yet another way to approach GF(28) multiplication is to implement it as a lookup into two 256-byte arrays, usually called alog[] and log[] because they are based on certain logarithm-like properties of GF(28).</p>
<p>Although the AES class presented here is fully capable of encrypting any form of .NET data, you might want to consider extending it in a number of ways. First, because the emphasis of this article is on presenting a clear explanation of AES, all error checking was stripped away. In my experience, adding a reasonable amount of error checking to a class similar to this AES class would triple the size of the source code. Because AES uses so many arrays, there is a lot of index bounds checking that should be done. For example, the constructor presented does not even check the size of the seed key parameter.</p>
<p>You might also consider extending this AES class by adding more features. The most obvious place to start would be to add methods that encrypt and decrypt fundamental .NET data types such as System.String and System.Int32. A more ambitious extension would be to implement an encrypted stream class.</p>
<p>How secure is AES? This is a hard question to answer, but the general consensus is that it is the most secure encryption algorithm available. AES has been subjected to more scrutiny than any other encryption algorithm to date. On both a theoretical and practical basis, AES is considered “secure” in the sense that the only effective way to crack it is through a brute-force generation of all possible keys. With a key size of 256 bits, no known brute-force attack can break AES in a reasonable amount of time (it would take years even on the fastest systems available).</p>
<p>Note that the most likely successful attack on an AES cipher results from a weak implementation that allows what is called a timing attack. The attacker uses different keys and precisely measures the time the encryption routine requires. If the encryption routine is carelessly coded so that execution time depends on the key value, it is possible to deduce information about the key. In AES, this is most likely to occur in the MixColumns routine because of field multiplication. Two safeguards against this attack are to insert dummy instructions so that all multiplications require the same number of instructions, or to implement field multiplication as a lookup table, as I’ve described.</p>
<p>There are many possible implementations of AES, especially using lookup tables rather than computation. The basic AES class presented in this article can be used to encrypt and decrypt any form of .NET data or can be extended into a class with added functionality.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The new AES will certainly become the de facto standard for encrypting all forms of electronic information, replacing DES. AES-encrypted data is unbreakable in the sense that no known cryptanalysis attack can decrypt the AES cipher text without using a brute-force search through all possible 256-bit keys.</p>
<p>The major obstacle I found when implementing an AES class in the Microsoft® .NET Framework was that the official specification document was written from a mathematician’s point of view rather than from a software developer’s point of view. In particular, the specification assumes that the reader is fairly familiar with the GF(28) field and it leaves out a few key facts regarding GF(28) multiplication that are necessary to correctly implement AES. I’ve tried here to remove the mystery from AES, especially surrounding GF(28) field multiplication.</p>
<p>It is only a question of time before AES encryption becomes widely available from Microsoft and third-party vendors in the form of .NET Framework libraries. However, having this code in your skill set will remain valuable for a number of reasons. This implementation is particularly simple and will have low resource overhead. In addition, access to and an understanding of the source code will enable you to customize the AES class and use any implementation of it more effectively.</p>
<p>Security is no longer an afterthought in anyone’s software design and development process. AES is an important advance and using and understanding it will greatly increase the reliability and safety of your software systems.</p>

<h2 id="HTTP协议是无状态的">HTTP协议是无状态的</h2><p>http协议是无状态的，同一个客户端的这次请求和上次请求是没有对应关系，对http服务器来说，它并不知道这两个请求来自同一个客户端。 为了解决这个问题， Web程序引入了Cookie机制来维护状态.</p>
<h2 id="HTTP消息的结构">HTTP消息的结构</h2><p>先看Request 消息的结构，Request消息分为3部分，第一部分叫请求行（单行字符串）， 第二部分叫http header，（由很多字符串键值对组成），第三部分是body，header和body之间有个空行。</p>
<p>结构如下图<br><img src="../http-protocol-detail/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>第一行中的Method表示请求方法，比如”POST”，”GET”，  Path-to-resoure表示请求的资源， Http/version-number 表示HTTP协议的版本号<strong>当使用的是”GET” 方法的时候， body是为空的</strong>，比如我们打开博客园首页的request 如下<br><figure class="highlight http"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="request">GET <span class="string">http://www.cnblogs.com/</span> HTTP/1.1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Host</span>: <span class="string">www.cnblogs.com</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>我们用Fiddler 捕捉一个博客园登录的Request 然后分析下它的结构， 在Inspectors tab下以Raw的方式可以看到完整的Request的消息，如下图<br><img src="../http-protocol-detail/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>我们再看Response消息的结构，和Request消息的结构基本一样。 同样也分为三部分，第一部分叫request line，第二部分叫request header，第三部分是body. header和body之间也有个空行，结构如下图<br><img src="../http-protocol-detail/5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>HTTP/version-number表示HTTP协议的版本号，status-code 和message 请看下节[状态代码]的详细解释。</p>

<h2 id="Get和Post方法的区别">Get和Post方法的区别</h2><p>Http协议定义了很多与服务器交互的方法，最基本的有4种，分别是GET,POST,PUT,DELETE. 一个URL地址用于描述一个网络上的资源，而HTTP中的GET, POST, PUT, DELETE就对应着对这个资源的查，改，增，删4个操作。 我们最常见的就是GET和POST了。GET一般用于获取/查询资源信息，而POST一般用于更新资源信息.</p>
<p>我们看看GET和POST的区别</p>
<ol>
<li>GET提交的数据会放在URL之后，以?分割URL和传输数据，参数之间以&amp;相连，如EditPosts.aspx?name=test1&amp;id=123456.  POST方法是把提交的数据放在HTTP包的Body中.</li>
<li>GET提交的数据大小有限制（因为浏览器对URL的长度有限制），而POST方法提交的数据没有限制.</li>
<li>GET方式需要使用Request.QueryString来取得变量的值，而POST方式通过Request.Form来获取变量的值。</li>
<li>GET方式提交数据，会带来安全问题，比如一个登录页面，通过GET方式提交数据时，用户名和密码将出现在URL上，如果页面可以被缓存或者其他人可以访问这台机器，就可以从历史记录获得该用户的账号和密码。</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="状态码">状态码</h2><p>Response 消息中的第一行叫做状态行，由HTTP协议版本号， 状态码， 状态消息 三部分组成。<br>状态码用来告诉HTTP客户端，HTTP服务器是否产生了预期的Response.<br>HTTP/1.1中定义了5类状态码， 状态码由三位数字组成，第一个数字定义了响应的类别</p>
<ul>
<li>1XX  提示信息 - 表示请求已被成功接收，继续处理</li>
<li>2XX  成功 - 表示请求已被成功接收，理解，接受</li>
<li>3XX  重定向 - 要完成请求必须进行更进一步的处理</li>
<li>4XX  客户端错误 -  请求有语法错误或请求无法实现</li>
<li>5XX  服务器端错误 -   服务器未能实现合法的请求</li>
</ul>
<p>看看一些常见的状态码<code>200</code> OK<br>最常见的就是成功响应状态码<code>200</code>了， 这表明该请求被成功地完成，所请求的资源发送回客户端，如下图，打开博客园首页<br><img src="../http-protocol-detail/7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>302 Found<br>重定向，新的URL会在response中的Location中返回，浏览器将会使用新的URL发出新的Request。</p>
<p>例如在IE中输入<a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.google.com</a>. HTTP服务器会返回304， IE取到Response中Location header的新URL, 又重新发送了一个Request.<br><img src="../http-protocol-detail/8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>304 Not Modified<br>代表上次的文档已经被缓存了， 还可以继续使用，<br>例如打开博客园首页， 发现很多 Response 的status code 都是304<br><img src="../http-protocol-detail/9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>提示：　如果你不想使用本地缓存可以用Ctrl+F5强制刷新页面<br>400 Bad Request  客户端请求与语法错误，不能被服务器所理解<br>403 Forbidden 服务器收到请求，但是拒绝提供服务<br>404 Not Found<br>请求资源不存在（输错了URL）<br>比如在IE中输入一个错误的URL， <a href="http://www.cnblogs.com/tesdf.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.cnblogs.com/tesdf.aspx</a><br><img src="../http-protocol-detail/10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>500 Internal Server Error 服务器发生了不可预期的错误<br>503 Server Unavailable 服务器当前不能处理客户端的请求，一段时间后可能恢复正常</p>
<h2 id="HTTP_Request_header">HTTP Request header</h2><p>使用Fiddler 能很方便的查看Reques header, 点击Inspectors tab -&gt; Request tab -&gt; headers  如下图所示.<br><img src="../http-protocol-detail/12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>header 有很多，比较难以记忆，我们也按照Fiddler那样把header 进行分类，这样比较清晰也容易记忆。</p>
<h3 id="Cache_头域">Cache 头域</h3><p>If-Modified-Since<br>作用： 把浏览器端缓存页面的最后修改时间发送到服务器去，服务器会把这个时间与服务器上实际文件的最后修改时间进行对比。如果时间一致，那么返回304，客户端就直接使用本地缓存文件。如果时间不一致，就会返回200和新的文件内容。客户端接到之后，会丢弃旧文件，把新文件缓存起来，并显示在浏览器中。<br>例如：If-Modified-Since: Thu, 09 Feb 2012 09:07:57 GMT<br>实例如下图<br><img src="../http-protocol-detail/13.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If-None-Match<br>作用: If-None-Match和ETag一起工作，工作原理是在HTTP Response中添加ETag信息。 当用户再次请求该资源时，将在HTTP Request 中加入If-None-Match信息(ETag的值)。如果服务器验证资源的ETag没有改变（该资源没有更新），将返回一个304状态告诉客户端使用本地缓存文件。否则将返回200状态和新的资源和Etag.  使用这样的机制将提高网站的性能<br>例如: If-None-Match: “03f2b33c0bfcc1:0”<br>实例如下图<br><img src="../http-protocol-detail/14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Pragma<br>作用： 防止页面被缓存， 在HTTP/1.1版本中，它和Cache-Control:no-cache作用一模一样<br>Pargma只有一个用法， 例如： Pragma: no-cache<br>注意: 在HTTP/1.0版本中，只实现了Pragema:no-cache, 没有实现Cache-Control<br>Cache-Control<br>作用: 这个是非常重要的规则。 这个用来指定Response-Request遵循的缓存机制。各个指令含义如下</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache-Control:Public   可以被任何缓存所缓存（）</li>
<li>Cache-Control:Private     内容只缓存到私有缓存中</li>
<li>Cache-Control:no-cache  所有内容都不会被缓存</li>
</ul>
<p>还有其他的一些用法， 我没搞懂其中的意思， 请大家参考其他的资料</p>
<h3 id="Client_头域">Client 头域</h3><ul>
<li><p>Accept<br>作用： 浏览器端可以接受的媒体类型,<br>例如：  Accept: text/html  代表浏览器可以接受服务器回发的类型为 text/html  也就是我们常说的html文档,<br>如果服务器无法返回text/html类型的数据，服务器应该返回一个406错误(non acceptable)<br>通配符 <em> 代表任意类型<br>例如  Accept: </em>/*  代表浏览器可以处理所有类型，(一般浏览器发给服务器都是发这个)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Accept-Encoding：<br>作用： 浏览器申明自己接收的编码方法，通常指定压缩方法，是否支持压缩，支持什么压缩方法（gzip，deflate），（注意：这不是只字符编码）;<br>例如： Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Accept-Language<br>作用： 浏览器申明自己接收的语言。<br>语言跟字符集的区别：中文是语言，中文有多种字符集，比如big5，gb2312，gbk等等；<br>例如： Accept-Language: en-us</p>
</li>
<li><p>User-Agent<br>作用：告诉HTTP服务器， 客户端使用的操作系统和浏览器的名称和版本.<br>我们上网登陆论坛的时候，往往会看到一些欢迎信息，其中列出了你的操作系统的名称和版本，你所使用的浏览器的名称和版本，这往往让很多人感到很神奇，实际上，服务器应用程序就是从User-Agent这个请求报头域中获取到这些信息User-Agent请求报头域允许客户端将它的操作系统、浏览器和其它属性告诉服务器。<br>例如： User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; CIBA; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0C; InfoPath.2; .NET4.0E)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Accept-Charset<br>作用：浏览器申明自己接收的字符集，这就是本文前面介绍的各种字符集和字符编码，如gb2312，utf-8（通常我们说Charset包括了相应的字符编码方案）；</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Cookie/Login_头域">Cookie/Login 头域</h2><ul>
<li>Cookie:<br>作用： 最重要的header, 将cookie的值发送给HTTP 服务器</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Entity头域">Entity头域</h3><ul>
<li><p>Content-Length<br>作用：发送给HTTP服务器数据的长度。<br>例如： Content-Length: 38</p>
</li>
<li><p>Content-Type<br>作用：<br>例如：Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Miscellaneous_头域">Miscellaneous 头域</h3><ul>
<li>Referer:<br>作用： 提供了Request的上下文信息的服务器，告诉服务器我是从哪个链接过来的，比如从我主页上链接到一个朋友那里，他的服务器就能够从HTTP Referer中统计出每天有多少用户点击我主页上的链接访问他的网站。<br>例如: Referer:<a href="http://translate.google.cn/?hl=zh-cn&amp;tab=wT" target="_blank" rel="external">http://translate.google.cn/?hl=zh-cn&amp;tab=wT</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Transport_头域">Transport 头域</h3><ul>
<li><p>Connection<br>例如：　Connection: keep-alive   当一个网页打开完成后，客户端和服务器之间用于传输HTTP数据的TCP连接不会关闭，如果客户端再次访问这个服务器上的网页，会继续使用这一条已经建立的连接<br>例如：  Connection: close  代表一个Request完成后，客户端和服务器之间用于传输HTTP数据的TCP连接会关闭， 当客户端再次发送Request，需要重新建立TCP连接。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Host（发送请求时，该报头域是必需的）<br>作用: 请求报头域主要用于指定被请求资源的Internet主机和端口号，它通常从HTTP URL中提取出来的<br>例如: 我们在浏览器中输入：<a href="http://www.guet.edu.cn/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.guet.edu.cn/index.html</a><br>浏览器发送的请求消息中，就会包含Host请求报头域，如下：<br>Host：<a href="http://www.guet.edu.cn" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.guet.edu.cn</a><br>此处使用缺省端口号80，若指定了端口号，则变成：Host：指定端口号</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="HTTP_Response_header">HTTP Response header</h3><ul>
<li>同样使用Fiddler 查看Response header, 点击Inspectors tab -&gt;Response tab-&gt; headers 我们也按照Fiddler那样把header 进行分类，这样比较清晰也容易记忆。如下图所示<br><img src="../http-protocol-detail/15.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Cache头域">Cache头域</h3><ul>
<li>Date<br>作用:  生成消息的具体时间和日期<br>例如：　Date: Sat, 11 Feb 2012 11:35:14 GMT </li>
<li>Expires<br>作用: 浏览器会在指定过期时间内使用本地缓存<br>例如: Expires: Tue, 08 Feb 2022 11:35:14 GMT</li>
<li>Vary<br>作用：<br>例如: Vary: Accept-Encoding</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Cookie/Login_头域-1">Cookie/Login 头域</h3><ul>
<li>P3P<br>作用: 用于跨域设置Cookie, 这样可以解决iframe跨域访问cookie的问题<br>例如: P3P: CP=CURa ADMa DEVa PSAo PSDo OUR BUS UNI PUR INT DEM STA PRE COM NAV OTC NOI DSP COR</li>
<li>Set-Cookie<br>作用： 非常重要的header, 用于把cookie 发送到客户端浏览器， 每一个写入cookie都会生成一个Set-Cookie.<br>例如: Set-Cookie: sc=4c31523a; path=/; domain=.acookie.taobao.com<br><img src="../http-protocol-detail/16.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Entity头域-1">Entity头域</h3><ul>
<li>ETag<br>作用:  和If-None-Match 配合使用。 （实例请看上节中If-None-Match的实例）<br>例如: ETag: “03f2b33c0bfcc1:0”</li>
<li>Last-Modified:<br>作用： 用于指示资源的最后修改日期和时间。（实例请看上节的If-Modified-Since的实例）<br>例如: Last-Modified: Wed, 21 Dec 2011 09:09:10 GMT</li>
<li>Content-Type<br>作用：WEB服务器告诉浏览器自己响应的对象的类型和字符集,<br>例如:<br>Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8<br>Content-Type:text/html;charset=GB2312<br>Content-Type: image/jpeg</li>
<li>Content-Length<br>指明实体正文的长度，以字节方式存储的十进制数字来表示。在数据下行的过程中，Content-Length的方式要预先在服务器中缓存所有数据，然后所有数据再一股脑儿地发给客户端。<br>例如: Content-Length: 19847</li>
<li>Content-Encoding<br>WEB服务器表明自己使用了什么压缩方法（gzip，deflate）压缩响应中的对象。<br>例如：Content-Encoding：gzip</li>
<li>Content-Language<br>作用： WEB服务器告诉浏览器自己响应的对象的语言者<br>例如： Content-Language:da</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Miscellaneous_头域-1">Miscellaneous 头域</h3><ul>
<li>Server:<br>作用：指明HTTP服务器的软件信息<br>例如:Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5</li>
<li>X-AspNet-Version:<br>作用：如果网站是用ASP.NET开发的，这个header用来表示ASP.NET的版本<br>例如: X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319</li>
<li>X-Powered-By:<br>作用：表示网站是用什么技术开发的<br>例如： X-Powered-By: ASP.NET</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Transport头域">Transport头域</h3><ul>
<li>Connection<br>例如：　Connection: keep-alive   当一个网页打开完成后，客户端和服务器之间用于传输HTTP数据的TCP连接不会关闭，如果客户端再次访问这个服务器上的网页，会继续使用这一条已经建立的连接<br>例如：  Connection: close  代表一个Request完成后，客户端和服务器之间用于传输HTTP数据的TCP连接会关闭， 当客户端再次发送Request，需要重新建立TCP连接。</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Location头域">Location头域</h3><ul>
<li>Location<br>作用： 用于重定向一个新的位置， 包含新的URL地址<br>实例请看304状态实例</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="HTTP协议是无状态的和Connection:_keep-alive的区别">HTTP协议是无状态的和Connection: keep-alive的区别</h2><p>无状态是指协议对于事务处理没有记忆能力，服务器不知道客户端是什么状态。从另一方面讲，打开一个服务器上的网页和你之前打开这个服务器上的网页之间没有任何联系。</p>
<p>HTTP是一个无状态的面向连接的协议，无状态不代表HTTP不能保持TCP连接，更不能代表HTTP使用的是UDP协议（无连接）。<br>从HTTP/1.1起，默认都开启了Keep-Alive，保持连接特性，简单地说，当一个网页打开完成后，客户端和服务器之间用于传输HTTP数据的TCP连接不会关闭，如果客户端再次访问这个服务器上的网页，会继续使用这一条已经建立的连接。</p>
<p>Keep-Alive不会永久保持连接，它有一个保持时间，可以在不同的服务器软件（如Apache）中设定这个时间。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="开始">开始</h2><p>这篇教程虽不是全原创但确是本人整理得来的，一篇博客能写完，所以说足够精简，包括Git的主要内容和大部分命令<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<h2 id="Git的起源">Git的起源</h2><p>因为Linus坚定地反对CVS和SVN，这些集中式的版本控制系统不但速度慢，而且必须联网才能使用。有一些商用的版本控制系统，虽然比CVS、SVN好用，但那是付费的，和Linux的开源精神不符。</p>
<p>不过，到了2002年，Linux系统已经发展了十年了，代码库之大让Linus很难继续通过手工方式管理了，社区的弟兄们也对这种方式表达了强烈不满，于是Linus选择了一个商业的版本控制系统BitKeeper，BitKeeper的东家BitMover公司出于人道主义精神，授权Linux社区免费使用这个版本控制系统。</p>
<p>安定团结的大好局面在2005年就被打破了，原因是Linux社区牛人聚集，不免沾染了一些梁山好汉的江湖习气。开发Samba的Andrew试图破解BitKeeper的协议（这么干的其实也不只他一个），被BitMover公司发现了（监控工作做得不错！），于是BitMover公司怒了，要收回Linux社区的免费使用权。</p>
<p>Linus可以向BitMover公司道个歉，保证以后严格管教弟兄们，嗯，这是不可能的。实际情况是这样的：</p>
<p>Linus花了两周时间自己用C写了一个分布式版本控制系统，这就是Git！一个月之内，Linux系统的源码已经由Git管理了！牛是怎么定义的呢？大家可以体会一下。</p>
<p>Git迅速成为最流行的分布式版本控制系统，尤其是2008年，GitHub网站上线了，它为开源项目免费提供Git存储，无数开源项目开始迁移至GitHub，包括jQuery，PHP，Ruby等等。</p>
<h2 id="Git的优势">Git的优势</h2><h3 id="集中式vs分布式">集中式vs分布式</h3><ul>
<li>集中式版本控制系统最大的毛病就是必须联网才能工作。</li>

</code></pre><h3 id="工作区与暂存区（Working_Directory_And_Stage）">工作区与暂存区（Working Directory And Stage）</h3><ul>
<li>工作区就是你在电脑里能看到的目录</li>
<li>第一步是用git add把文件添加进去，实际上就是把文件修改添加到暂存区；</li>
<li>第二步是用git commit提交更改，实际上就是把暂存区的所有内容提交到当前分支。<ul>
<li>因为我们创建Git版本库时，Git自动为我们创建了唯一一个master分支，所以，现在，git commit就是往master分支上提交更改。</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="管理修改">管理修改</h3><p>为什么Git比其他版本控制系统设计得优秀，因为Git跟踪并管理的是修改，而非文件。</p>
<p>你会问，什么是修改？比如你新增了一行，这就是一个修改，删除了一行，也是一个修改，更改了某些字符，也是一个修改，删了一些又加了一些，也是一个修改，甚至创建一个新文件，也算一个修改。</p>
<pre><code>$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for <span class="operator"><span class="keyword">commit</span>:
#   (<span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="string">"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> <span class="keyword">to</span> <span class="keyword">update</span> what will be committed)
#   (<span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="string">"git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..."</span> <span class="keyword">to</span> discard changes <span class="keyword">in</span> working <span class="keyword">directory</span>)
#
#    modified:   readme.txt
#
<span class="keyword">no</span> changes added <span class="keyword">to</span> <span class="keyword">commit</span> (<span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="string">"git add"</span> <span class="keyword">and</span>/<span class="keyword">or</span> <span class="string">"git commit -a"</span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>git status命令可以让我们时刻掌握仓库当前的状态，上面的命令告诉我们，readme.txt被修改过了，但还没有准备提交的修改。</p>
<pre><code>$ git diff readme.txt 
diff --git a/readme.txt b/readme.txt
index 46d49bf..9247db6 100644
<span class="header">--- a/readme.txt</span>
<span class="header">+++ b/readme.txt</span>
<span class="chunk">@@ -1,2 +1,2 @@</span>
<span class="deletion">-Git is a version control system.</span>
<span class="addition">+Git is a distributed version control system.</span>
 Git is free software.
</code></pre><p>git diff顾名思义就是查看difference，显示的格式正是Unix通用的diff格式，可以从上面的命令输出看到，我们在第一行添加了一个“distributed”单词。</p>
<p><strong>所以需要特别注意文档的编码格式</strong></p>
<p>首先这里再明确一下，所有的版本控制系统，其实只能跟踪文本文件的改动，比如TXT文件，网页，所有的程序代码等等，Git也不例外。版本控制系统可以告诉你每次的改动，比如在第5行加了一个单词“Linux”，在第8行删了一个单词“Windows”。而图片、视频这些二进制文件，虽然也能由版本控制系统管理，但没法跟踪文件的变化，只能把二进制文件每次改动串起来，也就是只知道图片从100KB改成了120KB，但到底改了啥，版本控制系统不知道，也没法知道。</p>
<p>不幸的是，Microsoft的Word格式是二进制格式，因此，版本控制系统是没法跟踪Word文件的改动的，前面我们举的例子只是为了演示，如果要真正使用版本控制系统，就要以纯文本方式编写文件。</p>
<p>因为文本是有编码的，比如中文有常用的GBK编码，日文有Shift_JIS编码，如果没有历史遗留问题，强烈建议使用标准的UTF-8编码，所有语言使用同一种编码，既没有冲突，又被所有平台所支持。</p>
<p><strong>使用Windows的童鞋要特别注意</strong></p>
<p>千万不要使用Windows自带的记事本编辑任何文本文件。原因是Microsoft开发记事本的团队使用了一个非常弱智的行为来保存UTF-8编码的文件，他们自作聪明地在每个文件开头添加了0xefbbbf（十六进制）的字符，你会遇到很多不可思议的问题，比如，网页第一行可能会显示一个“?”，明明正确的程序一编译就报语法错误，等等，都是由记事本的弱智行为带来的。建议你下载Notepad++代替记事本，不但功能强大，而且免费！记得把Notepad++的默认编码设置为UTF-8 without BOM即可：</p>
<h3 id="撤销修改">撤销修改</h3><pre><code>git checkout <span class="comment">-- file</span>
</code></pre><p>命令git checkout – readme.txt意思就是，把readme.txt文件在工作区的修改全部撤销，这里有两种情况：</p>
<p>一种是readme.txt自修改后还没有被放到暂存区，现在，撤销修改就回到和版本库一模一样的状态；</p>
<p>一种是readme.txt已经添加到暂存区后，又作了修改，现在，撤销修改就回到添加到暂存区后的状态。</p>
<p>总之，就是让这个文件回到最近一次git commit或git add时的状态。</p>
<h3 id="删除文件">删除文件</h3><ul>
<li>直接在文件管理器中把没用的文件删了</li>
<li>用rm命令</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="杀手锏武器：分支（branch）">杀手锏武器：分支（branch）</h2><p>分支在实际中有什么用呢？假设你准备开发一个新功能，但是需要两周才能完成，第一周你写了50%的代码，如果立刻提交，由于代码还没写完，不完整的代码库会导致别人不能干活了。如果等代码全部写完再一次提交，又存在丢失每天进度的巨大风险。</p>
<p>现在有了分支，就不用怕了。你创建了一个属于你自己的分支，别人看不到，还继续在原来的分支上正常工作，而你在自己的分支上干活，想提交就提交，直到开发完毕后，再一次性合并到原来的分支上，这样，既安全，又不影响别人工作。</p>
<p>所以我们在github上看到的大一点项目基本都有分支，常见的有master分支，还有一个开发版dev，还有一个分布式版parallel</p>
<h3 id="分支的作用">分支的作用</h3><p>当我们创建新的分支，例如dev时，Git新建了一个指针叫dev，指向master相同的提交，再把HEAD指向dev，就表示当前分支在dev上。Git创建一个分支很快，因为除了增加一个dev指针，改改HEAD的指向，工作区的文件都没有任何变化！</p>
<p>不过，从现在开始，对工作区的修改和提交就是针对dev分支了，比如新提交一次后，dev指针往前移动一步，而master指针不变：</p>
<p><img src="../git-gettng-start/b1.png" alt="b1"><br><img src="../git-gettng-start/b2.png" alt="b1"></p>
<p>假如我们在dev上的工作完成了，就可以把dev合并到master上。Git怎么合并呢？最简单的方法，就是直接把master指向dev的当前提交，就完成了合并：</p>
<p><img src="../git-gettng-start/b3.png" alt="b1"></p>
<p>所以Git合并分支也很快！就改改指针，工作区内容也不变！</p>
<p>合并完分支后，甚至可以删除dev分支。删除dev分支就是把dev指针给删掉，删掉后，我们就剩下了一条master分支：</p>
<p><img src="../git-gettng-start/b4.png" alt="b1"></p>
<h3 id="举例说明">举例说明</h3><pre><code>$ git checkout -<span class="tag">b</span> dev
Switched to <span class="tag">a</span> new branch <span class="string">'dev'</span>
</code></pre><p><code>git checkout</code>命令加上<code>-b</code>参数表示创建并切换，相当于以下两条命令：</p>
<pre><code>$ git <span class="keyword">branch </span>dev
$ git checkout dev
<span class="keyword">Switched </span>to <span class="keyword">branch </span><span class="string">'dev'</span>
</code></pre><p>然后，用<code>git branch</code>命令查看当前分支：</p>
<pre><code>$ git <span class="keyword">branch
</span>* dev
  master
</code></pre><p><code>git branch</code>命令会列出所有分支，当前分支前面会标一个*号。</p>
<p>然后，我们下面的所有工作就都是在dev分支上进行的了。</p>
<pre><code>$ git add readme.txt 
$ git <span class="operator"><span class="keyword">commit</span> -<span class="keyword">m</span> <span class="string">"branch test"</span>
[dev fec145a] branch <span class="keyword">test</span>
 <span class="number">1</span> <span class="keyword">file</span> <span class="keyword">changed</span>, <span class="number">1</span> insertion(+)</span>
</code></pre><p>现在，<code>dev</code>分支的工作完成，我们就可以切换回<code>master</code>分支：</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout <span class="keyword">master</span>
<span class="title">Switched</span> to branch '<span class="literal">master</span>'
</code></pre><p><img src="../git-gettng-start/b5.png" alt="b1"></p>
<p>现在，我们把<code>dev</code>分支的工作成果合并到<code>master</code>分支上：</p>
<pre><code>$ git <span class="operator"><span class="keyword">merge</span> dev
Updating d17efd8..fec145a
<span class="keyword">Fast</span>-forward
 readme.txt |    <span class="number">1</span> +
 <span class="number">1</span> <span class="keyword">file</span> <span class="keyword">changed</span>, <span class="number">1</span> insertion(+)</span>
</code></pre><p>git merge命令用于合并指定分支到当前分支。合并后，再查看readme.txt的内容，就可以看到，和dev分支的最新提交是完全一样的。</p>
<p>注意到上面的Fast-forward信息，Git告诉我们，这次合并是“快进模式”，也就是直接把master指向dev的当前提交，所以合并速度非常快。</p>
<p>当然，也不是每次合并都能Fast-forward（当没有冲突时可以），我们后面会将其他方式的合并。</p>
<p>合并完成后，就可以放心地删除dev分支了：</p>
<h3 id="解决冲突">解决冲突</h3><p><img src="../git-gettng-start/m1.png" alt="m1"></p>
<pre><code>$ git merge feature1
<span class="type">Auto</span>-merging readme.txt

<span class="type">Automatic</span> merge failed; fix conflicts <span class="keyword">and</span> then commit the <span class="literal">result</span>.
</code></pre><p>果然冲突了！Git告诉我们，readme.txt文件存在冲突，必须手动解决冲突后再提交。git status也可以告诉我们冲突的文件：</p>
<pre><code>$ git status
<span class="preprocessor"># On branch master</span>
<span class="preprocessor"># Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.</span>

<span class="preprocessor">#</span>
no changes added to commit (use <span class="string">"git add"</span> and/or <span class="string">"git commit -a"</span>)
</code></pre><p>我们可以直接查看readme.txt的内容：</p>

</code></pre><p>再次合并分支</p>
<p><img src="../git-gettng-start/m2.png" alt="m2"></p>
<p>最后，删除<code>feature1</code>分支：</p>
<pre><code>$ git <span class="keyword">branch </span>-d feature1
<span class="label">Deleted</span> <span class="keyword">branch </span>feature1 (was <span class="number">75</span>a857c).
</code></pre><h3 id="分支命令">分支命令</h3><p>Git鼓励大量使用分支：</p>
<p>查看分支：<code>git branch</code></p>
<p>创建分支：<code>git branch &lt;name&gt;</code></p>
<p>切换分支：<code>git checkout &lt;name&gt;</code></p>
<p>创建+切换分支：<code>git checkout -b &lt;name&gt;</code></p>
<p>合并某分支到当前分支：<code>git merge &lt;name&gt;</code></p>
<p>删除分支：<code>git branch -d &lt;name&gt;</code></p>
<h2 id="多人协作与远程仓库">多人协作与远程仓库</h2><p>当你从远程仓库克隆时，实际上Git自动把本地的master分支和远程的master分支对应起来了，并且，远程仓库的默认名称是origin。</p>
<h3 id="跟踪">跟踪</h3><p>本地的一个分支会对应一个远程分支，跟踪就是方便我们push和pull，（master是自动跟踪的）</p>
<p>跟踪的命令<code>track</code></p>
<pre><code>git branch --track <span class="built_in">dev</span> origin/<span class="built_in">dev</span>
</code></pre><h3 id="查看">查看</h3><p>要查看远程库的信息，用git remote：</p>
<pre><code><span class="variable">$ </span>git remote
origin
</code></pre><p>或者，用git remote -v显示更详细的信息：</p>
<pre><code>$ git remote -v
origin  git@github<span class="class">.com</span>:michaelliao/learngit<span class="class">.git</span> (fetch)
origin  git@github<span class="class">.com</span>:michaelliao/learngit<span class="class">.git</span> (push)
</code></pre><h3 id="推送">推送</h3><p>推送分支，就是把该分支上的所有本地提交推送到远程库。推送时，要指定本地分支（track过的不用），这样，Git就会把该分支推送到远程库对应的远程分支上：</p>
<pre><code>$ git <span class="keyword">push </span>origin master
</code></pre><p>如果要推送其他分支，比如dev，就改成：</p>
<pre><code>$ git <span class="keyword">push </span>origin dev
</code></pre><p>但是，并不是一定要把本地分支往远程推送，那么，哪些分支需要推送，哪些不需要呢？</p>
<h3 id="冲突">冲突</h3><p>然后如果远程的仓库被改动过了，则我们不能push到仓库，这个时候首先要pull抓回来，然后再本地合并分支，没有冲突以后再push到仓库</p>
<pre><code>git pull origin <span class="literal">master</span>
</code></pre><h2 id="注意事项">注意事项</h2><h3 id="ignore文件">ignore文件</h3><p>git项目可以在根目录下放一个.gitignore的文件，从名字上我们可以看出是一个忽略列表。通常我们需要配置这个文件，使git只包含我们项目中的源代码，比如一个c++项目，我们只需要包含.cpp .h 还有makefile文件，其他中间文件和最终的可执行文件都不用包含在我们的项目中。所以我们在建立git项目的时候一般需要有这么几个文件夹，src,include,bin,obj,lib，在配置makefile的时候最好这样规划。另外lib和include因为是共有的，最好统一配置。</p>
<h3 id="权限问题">权限问题</h3><p>在配置远程仓库的时候，因为用ssh协议传输，需要配置ssh权限<br>git-gui-&gt;help-&gt;show ssh key=&gt;将生成的密钥发给服务器，然后服务器添加到当前git用户的.ssh目录下的authorized_keys文件中即可</p>

-- Two dashes start a one-line comment.

--[[
     Adding two ['s and ]'s makes it a
     multi-line comment.
--]]

----------------------------------------------------
-- 1\. Variables and flow control.
----------------------------------------------------

num = 42  -- All numbers are doubles.
-- Don't freak out, 64-bit doubles have 52 bits for
-- storing exact int values; machine precision is
-- not a problem for ints that need < 52 bits.

s = 'walternate'  -- Immutable strings like Python.
t = "double-quotes are also fine"
u = [[ Double brackets
       start and end
       multi-line strings.]]
t = nil  -- Undefines t; Lua has garbage collection.

-- Blocks are denoted with keywords like do/end:
while num < 50 do
  num = num + 1  -- No ++ or += type operators.
end

-- If clauses:
if num > 40 then
  print('over 40')
elseif s ~= 'walternate' then  -- ~= is not equals.
  -- Equality check is == like Python; ok for strs.
  io.write('not over 40n')  -- Defaults to stdout.
else
  -- Variables are global by default.
  thisIsGlobal = 5  -- Camel case is common.

  -- How to make a variable local:
  local line = io.read()  -- Reads next stdin line.

  -- String concatenation uses the .. operator:
  print('Winter is coming, ' .. line)
end

-- Undefined variables return nil.
-- This is not an error:
foo = anUnknownVariable  -- Now foo = nil.

aBoolValue = false

-- Only nil and false are falsy; 0 and '' are true!
if not aBoolValue then print('twas false') end

-- 'or' and 'and' are short-circuited.
-- This is similar to the a?b:c operator in C/js:
ans = aBoolValue and 'yes' or 'no'  --> 'no'

karlSum = 0
for i = 1, 100 do  -- The range includes both ends.
  karlSum = karlSum + i
end

-- Use "100, 1, -1" as the range to count down:
fredSum = 0
for j = 100, 1, -1 do fredSum = fredSum + j end

-- In general, the range is begin, end[, step].

-- Another loop construct:
repeat
  print('the way of the future')
  num = num - 1
until num == 0

----------------------------------------------------
-- 2\. Functions.
----------------------------------------------------

function fib(n)
  if n < 2 then return 1 end
  return fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1)
end

-- Closures and anonymous functions are ok:
function adder(x)
  -- The returned function is created when adder is
  -- called, and remembers the value of x:
  return function (y) return x + y end
end
a1 = adder(9)
a2 = adder(36)
print(a1(16))  --> 25
print(a2(64))  --> 100

-- Returns, func calls, and assignments all work
-- with lists that may be mismatched in length.
-- Unmatched receivers are nil;
-- unmatched senders are discarded.

x, y, z = 1, 2, 3, 4
-- Now x = 1, y = 2, z = 3, and 4 is thrown away.

function bar(a, b, c)
  print(a, b, c)
  return 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42
end

x, y = bar('zaphod')  --> prints "zaphod  nil nil"
-- Now x = 4, y = 8, values 15..42 are discarded.

-- Functions are first-class, may be local/global.
-- These are the same:
function f(x) return x * x end
f = function (x) return x * x end

-- And so are these:
local function g(x) return math.sin(x) end
local g; g  = function (x) return math.sin(x) end
-- the 'local g' decl makes g-self-references ok.

-- Trig funcs work in radians, by the way.

-- Calls with one string param don't need parens:
print 'hello'  -- Works fine.

----------------------------------------------------
-- 3\. Tables.
----------------------------------------------------

-- Tables = Lua's only compound data structure;
--          they are associative arrays.
-- Similar to php arrays or js objects, they are
-- hash-lookup dicts that can also be used as lists.

-- Using tables as dictionaries / maps:

-- Dict literals have string keys by default:
t = {key1 = 'value1', key2 = false}

-- String keys can use js-like dot notation:
print(t.key1)  -- Prints 'value1'.
t.newKey = {}  -- Adds a new key/value pair.
t.key2 = nil   -- Removes key2 from the table.

-- Literal notation for any (non-nil) value as key:
u = {['@!#'] = 'qbert', [{}] = 1729, [6.28] = 'tau'}
print(u[6.28])  -- prints "tau"

-- Key matching is basically by value for numbers
-- and strings, but by identity for tables.
a = u['@!#']  -- Now a = 'qbert'.
b = u[{}]     -- We might expect 1729, but it's nil:
-- b = nil since the lookup fails. It fails
-- because the key we used is not the same object
-- as the one used to store the original value. So
-- strings & numbers are more portable keys.

-- A one-table-param function call needs no parens:
function h(x) print(x.key1) end
h{key1 = 'Sonmi~451'}  -- Prints 'Sonmi~451'.

for key, val in pairs(u) do  -- Table iteration.
  print(key, val)
end

-- _G is a special table of all globals.
print(_G['_G'] == _G)  -- Prints 'true'.

-- Using tables as lists / arrays:

-- List literals implicitly set up int keys:
v = {'value1', 'value2', 1.21, 'gigawatts'}
for i = 1, #v do  -- #v is the size of v for lists.
  print(v[i])  -- Indices start at 1 !! SO CRAZY!
end
-- A 'list' is not a real type. v is just a table
-- with consecutive integer keys, treated as a list.

----------------------------------------------------
-- 3.1 Metatables and metamethods.
----------------------------------------------------

-- A table can have a metatable that gives the table
-- operator-overloadish behavior. Later we'll see
-- how metatables support js-prototypey behavior.

f1 = {a = 1, b = 2}  -- Represents the fraction a/b.
f2 = {a = 2, b = 3}

-- This would fail:
-- s = f1 + f2

metafraction = {}
function metafraction.__add(f1, f2)
  sum = {}
  sum.b = f1.b * f2.b
  sum.a = f1.a * f2.b + f2.a * f1.b
  return sum
end

setmetatable(f1, metafraction)
setmetatable(f2, metafraction)

s = f1 + f2  -- call __add(f1, f2) on f1's metatable

-- f1, f2 have no key for their metatable, unlike
-- prototypes in js, so you must retrieve it as in
-- getmetatable(f1). The metatable is a normal table
-- with keys that Lua knows about, like __add.

-- But the next line fails since s has no metatable:
-- t = s + s
-- Class-like patterns given below would fix this.

-- An __index on a metatable overloads dot lookups:
defaultFavs = {animal = 'gru', food = 'donuts'}
myFavs = {food = 'pizza'}
setmetatable(myFavs, {__index = defaultFavs})
eatenBy = myFavs.animal  -- works! thanks, metatable

-- Direct table lookups that fail will retry using
-- the metatable's __index value, and this recurses.

-- An __index value can also be a function(tbl, key)
-- for more customized lookups.

-- Values of __index,add, .. are called metamethods.
-- Full list. Here a is a table with the metamethod.

-- __add(a, b)                     for a + b
-- __sub(a, b)                     for a - b
-- __mul(a, b)                     for a * b
-- __div(a, b)                     for a / b
-- __mod(a, b)                     for a % b
-- __pow(a, b)                     for a ^ b
-- __unm(a)                        for -a
-- __concat(a, b)                  for a .. b
-- __len(a)                        for #a
-- __eq(a, b)                      for a == b
-- __lt(a, b)                      for a < b
-- __le(a, b)                      for a <= b="" --="" __index(a,="" b)="" <fn="" or="" a="" table="">  for a.b
-- __newindex(a, b, c)             for a.b = c
-- __call(a, ...)                  for a(...)

----------------------------------------------------
-- 3.2 Class-like tables and inheritance.
----------------------------------------------------

-- Classes aren't built in; there are different ways
-- to make them using tables and metatables.

-- Explanation for this example is below it.

Dog = {}                                   -- 1.

function Dog:new()                         -- 2.
  newObj = {sound = 'woof'}                -- 3.
  self.__index = self                      -- 4.
  return setmetatable(newObj, self)        -- 5.
end

function Dog:makeSound()                   -- 6.
  print('I say ' .. self.sound)
end

mrDog = Dog:new()                          -- 7.
mrDog:makeSound()  -- 'I say woof'         -- 8.

-- 1\. Dog acts like a class; it's really a table.
-- 2\. function tablename:fn(...) is the same as
--    function tablename.fn(self, ...)
--    The : just adds a first arg called self.
--    Read 7 & 8 below for how self gets its value.
-- 3\. newObj will be an instance of class Dog.
-- 4\. self = the class being instantiated. Often
--    self = Dog, but inheritance can change it.
--    newObj gets self's functions when we set both
--    newObj's metatable and self's __index to self.
-- 5\. Reminder: setmetatable returns its first arg.
-- 6\. The : works as in 2, but this time we expect
--    self to be an instance instead of a class.
-- 7\. Same as Dog.new(Dog), so self = Dog in new().
-- 8\. Same as mrDog.makeSound(mrDog); self = mrDog.

----------------------------------------------------

-- Inheritance example:

LoudDog = Dog:new()                           -- 1.

function LoudDog:makeSound()
  s = self.sound .. ' '                       -- 2.
  print(s .. s .. s)
end

seymour = LoudDog:new()                       -- 3.
seymour:makeSound()  -- 'woof woof woof'      -- 4.

-- 1\. LoudDog gets Dog's methods and variables.
-- 2\. self has a 'sound' key from new(), see 3.
-- 3\. Same as LoudDog.new(LoudDog), and converted to
--    Dog.new(LoudDog) as LoudDog has no 'new' key,
--    but does have __index = Dog on its metatable.
--    Result: seymour's metatable is LoudDog, and
--    LoudDog.__index = LoudDog. So seymour.key will
--    = seymour.key, LoudDog.key, Dog.key, whichever
--    table is the first with the given key.
-- 4\. The 'makeSound' key is found in LoudDog; this
--    is the same as LoudDog.makeSound(seymour).

-- If needed, a subclass's new() is like the base's:
function LoudDog:new()
  newObj = {}
  -- set up newObj
  self.__index = self
  return setmetatable(newObj, self)
end

----------------------------------------------------
-- 4\. Modules.
----------------------------------------------------

--[[ I'm commenting out this section so the rest of
--   this script remains runnable.

-- Suppose the file mod.lua looks like this:
local M = {}

local function sayMyName()
  print('Hrunkner')
end

function M.sayHello()
  print('Why hello there')
  sayMyName()
end

return M

-- Another file can use mod.lua's functionality:
local mod = require('mod')  -- Run the file mod.lua.

-- require is the standard way to include modules.
-- require acts like:     (if not cached; see below)
local mod = (function ()
  <contents of="" mod.lua="">
end)()
-- It's like mod.lua is a function body, so that
-- locals inside mod.lua are invisible outside it.

-- This works because mod here = M in mod.lua:
mod.sayHello()  -- Says hello to Hrunkner.

-- This is wrong; sayMyName only exists in mod.lua:
mod.sayMyName()  -- error

-- require's return values are cached so a file is
-- run at most once, even when require'd many times.

-- Suppose mod2.lua contains "print('Hi!')".
local a = require('mod2')  -- Prints Hi!
local b = require('mod2')  -- Doesn't print; a=b.

-- dofile is like require without caching:
dofile('mod2.lua')  --> Hi!
dofile('mod2.lua')  --> Hi! (runs it again)

-- loadfile loads a lua file but doesn't run it yet.
f = loadfile('mod2.lua')  -- Call f() to run it.

-- loadstring is loadfile for strings.
g = loadstring('print(343)')  -- Returns a function.
g()  -- Prints out 343; nothing printed before now.

I was excited to learn Lua so I could make games
with the Löve 2D game engine. That's the why.

I started with BlackBulletIV's Lua for programmers.
Next I read the official Programming in Lua book.
That's the how.

It might be helpful to check out the Lua short
reference on lua-users.org.

The main topics not covered are standard libraries:
 * string library
 * table library
 * math library
 * io library
 * os library

By the way, this entire file is valid Lua; save it
as learn.lua and run it with "lua learn.lua" !

This was first written for tylerneylon.com. It's
also available as a github gist. Tutorials for other
languages, in the same style as this one, are here:

http://learnxinyminutes.com/

Have fun with Lua!

<p>第一步：sudo passwd<br>第二步：输入密码<br>第三步：确认密码</p>
<p>这样三个步骤过后root用户的密码就设置好了<br>切入root用户， su root 输入刚刚设置好的密码就可以了</p>
<h2 id="2、创建用户及密码修改">2、创建用户及密码修改</h2><p>若修改root自己的密码，直接输入 passwd 然后输入两次密码即可。<br>若修改其他用户，如oracle 的密码，可直接输入passwd oracle 输入两遍性新密码即可。</p>
<h2 id="3、使用vim">3、使用vim</h2><p>学会使用vim很有必要，尤其是当通过远程管理linux主机的时候，因为此时无法用gedit等GUI软件，只能使用这种基于命令行的文本编辑器</p>
<p>vi有三种模式：<br>(1)一般模式：进入vi的默认模式，能够进行复制、黏贴、删除等操作；<br>(2)编辑模式：从一般模式按下‘i’即可进入；<br>(3)命令行模式：从一般模式按下“:”、’?’、’/‘即可进入；</p>
<p>注意：如果安装了vim后，输入vi后也是使用vim编辑器，我们输入alias后看到“alias vi=’vim’”；</p>
<p>“命令行模式”的常用按键</p>

</code></pre><h2 id="4、创建ftp">4、创建ftp</h2><p>4.1 Ubuntu 下安装FTP软件当然选择大名鼎鼎的vsftpd（very secure FTP daemon）， Ubuntu装vsftpd很简单，一句命令就行：</p>
<pre><code>sudo <span class="keyword">rm</span> /etc/pam.<span class="keyword">d</span>/vsftpd（在ubuntu14中请先执行这一条，若没有执行可能会报错，后面第4点会提到）
sudo apt-get install vsftpd
</code></pre><p>命令执行过程中，安装程序会给本地创建一个名为“ftp”的用户组，命令执行完之后会自动启动FTP服务。<br>可以使用“netstat -tl”命令检查FTP端口有没有已经打开，或者直接在浏览器里输入“ftp://你的服务器IP”（新安装的vsftpd默认是可以匿名不需要密码直接访问），如果能直接连接到FTP服务器，则安装vsftpd算是大功告成。</p>
<p>4.2 开启、停止、重启vsftpd服务也很简单：</p>
<pre><code>service vsftpd <span class="literal">start</span> | <span class="literal">stop</span> | restart
</code></pre><p>4.3 新安装的vsftpd默认是可以匿名访问，如果只想给某一个用户专门访问某一目录下的权限，则需要修改vsftpd的配置了。<br>首先，创建一个专门用来访问的用户，例如叫“test”：</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">mkdir</span> -p /home/<span class="keyword">test</span>
sudo useradd -<span class="keyword">g</span> ftp -<span class="keyword">d</span> /home/<span class="keyword">test</span> -<span class="keyword">M</span> <span class="keyword">test</span>   (这里关键就是选取你要的目录为ftp的根目录/home/<span class="keyword">test</span>，注意根目录是没有写入权限的，这个后面会提到)
</code></pre><p>解释一下useradd：<br>ftp代表用户组是ftp，必须设定<br>-g initial_group　group名称或以数字来做为使用者登入起始群组(group)。群组名须为现有存在的名称。<br>-d 是在指定的目录下进行建立如；<br>-M是不建立使用者目录，即使/etc/login.defs系统档设定要建立使用者目录</p>
<p>PS: 删除用户用以下命令：</p>
<p>sudo userdel test </p>
<p>设置密码:</p>
<p>passwd test</p>
<p>修改vsftpd的配置文件“vi /etc/vsftpd.conf”：</p>
<p>#禁止匿名访问<br>anonymous_enable=NO</p>
<p>#接受本地用户<br>local_enable=YES</p>
<p>#可以上传</p>
<p>#chroot_local_user=YES<br>(解释：chroot_local_user=YES将所有用户限定在主目录内，chroot_list_enable=YES表示要启用chroot_list_file, 因为chroot_local_user=YES，即全体用户都被“限定在主目录内”,所以总是作为“例外列表”的chroot_list_file这时列出的是那些“不会被限制在主目录下”的用户。)<br>write_enable=YES<br>local_umask=022</p>
<p>#启用在chroot_list_file的用户只能访问根目录<br>chroot_list_enable=YES<br>chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list</p>
<p>在/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list添加受访问目录限制的用户：</p>
<p>echo test &gt;&gt; vi /etc/vsftpd.chroot_list</p>
<p>可以在本地测试ftp<br>命令：ftp 127.0.0.1<br>输入当前用户的密码后显示 &gt;ftp<br>输入 bye 或者 quit 可以退出ftp</p>
<p>“500 OOPS: vsftpd: refusing to run with writable root inside chroot()”</p>
<p>启用了chroot的话，根目录要设置为不可写，这是vsftp的保护机制。</p>
<p>chmod a-w /home/test</p>
<p>那么用户登陆FTP就可以访问到test下的东西，但是没法去上传文件。如果把test文件夹设置成777权限，那么FTP就登陆不上去。</p>
<p>所以解决办法是。在test文件夹下再创建一个文件夹“/home/test/wwwroot”，将wwwroot设置成777就可以了，那么以后上传东西就上传到wwwroot里。</p>
<p>OK，重启vsftpd之后就可以使用上面新创建的账号访问。</p>
<p>4.4 但是使用ftp 命令登陆的时候总是提示如下的错误</p>
<p>root@server:~# ftp localhost<br>Connected to localhost.<br>220 (vsFTPd 2.3.5)<br>Name (localhost:root): ubuntu<br>331 Please specify the password.<br>Password:<br>530 Login incorrect.<br>Login failed.</p>
<p>于是我在网上搜了下看看大家都是怎么解决的，最后终于找到了解决的办法</p>
<p>sudo apt-get remove vsftpd<br>sudo rm /etc/pam.d/vsftpd<br>sudo apt-get install vsftpd  </p>
<p>这是因为ubuntu启用了PAM,所在用到vsftp时需要用到 /etc/pam.d/vsftpd 这个文件（默认源码安装的不会有这个文件），因此除了匿名用户外本地用户无法登录。所以只要删除了就可以了。</p>
<p>4.5 修改ftp的目录</p>
<h2 id="5、配置Mysql">5、配置Mysql</h2><p>5.1 在安装mysql的时候会设置一个初始的用户名和密码比如用户名可以上root，但是注意这个root不是系统的root<br>首先用初始密码登陆<br>mysql -h localhost -u root -p123   （密码是123，密码前面必须有一个p，而且必须连在一起）(注意有些时候localhost无法连接，需要换成127.0.0.1)</p>
<p>5.2 我们可以修改密码：<br>方法一：</p>
<p>mysql&gt;set password =password(&#039;你的密码&#039;);<br>mysql&gt;flush privileges;</p>
<p>方法二.使用GRANT语句</p>
<p>mysql&gt;grant all on <em>.</em> to &#039;root&#039;@&#039;localhost&#039; IDENTIFIED BY &#039;你的密码&#039;with grant option ;<br>mysql&gt;flush privileges;</p>
<p>方法三.进入mysql库修改user表</p>
<p>mysql&gt;use mysql;<br>mysql&gt;update user set password=password(&#039;你的密码&#039;) where user=&#039;root&#039;;<br>mysql&gt;flush privileges;</p>
<p>5.3 MySQL 连接远程数据库（192.168.0.201），端口“3306”，用户名为“root”，密码“123”</p>
<p>C:&gt;mysql -h 192.168.0.201 -P 3306 -u root -p123</p>
<p>赋予远程权限<br>在Ubuntu下需要首先：（为什么，不知道）<br>在目录/etc/mysql下找到my.cnf，用vim编辑，找到my.cnf里面的</p>
<p>bind-address           = 127.0.0.1<br>在mysql的命令行下面输入：</p>
<p>grant all privileges on databasename.<em> to root@120.00.00.00 identified by &#039;123456mima&#039;;   （databasename：是数据库名，也可以改为</em>，120.00.00.00，是你的ip，root是你的mysql用户名，）方法其实还用很多种，这种比较简单</p>
<p>比如更高权限的 grant all PRIVILEGES on <em>.</em> to admin@&#039;%&#039; identified by &#039;123456&#039;;  就是赋予了所有的数据库权限，用户名为admin，对于所有ip可以访问，密码123456.<br>flush privileges;</p>
<h2 id="6、附件一些其他模块的安装">6、附件一些其他模块的安装</h2><p>6.1 curl_init — 初始化一个cURL会话<br>解决办法：<br>1，安装php5-curl模块，默认路径会在/etc/php5/路径下</p>

<p>2，重启Apache服务器加载curl模块</p>
<p>sudo service apache restart   #或者是 sudo service apache2 restart</p>

<li><p>lua的简介<br>Lua 是一个小巧的脚本语言。是巴西里约热内卢天主教大学（Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro）里的一个研究小组，由Roberto Ierusalimschy、Waldemar Celes 和 Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo所组成并于1993年开发。 其设计目的是为了嵌入应用程序中，从而为应用程序提供灵活的扩展和定制功能。Lua由标准C编写而成，几乎在所有操作系统和平台上都可以编译，运行。Lua并没有提供强大的库，这是由它的定位决定的。所以Lua不适合作为开发独立应用程序的语言。Lua 有一个同时进行的JIT项目，提供在特定平台上的即时编译功能。</p>
<a id="more"></a>
</li>
<li><p>下载lua<br>lua官网的下载页面：<a href="http://www.lua.org/download.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.lua.org/download.html</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>lua包含的文件<br>下载后的lua是一个压缩包，解压后可以获得doc和src文件夹，还有makefile和readme文件。<br>doc文件夹下主要有lua的api文档<br>src文件夹包含lua的源码<br>（lua压缩包并不包含lib文件，lib文件直接通过vs去编译lua源代码就可以生成lib了，方法见第四步）</p>
</li>
<li><p>生成lua lib文件。<br>使用visual studio添加静态库项目</p>
</li>
<li><p>使用lua<br>在生成lib文件的步骤中的链接能看到如何在项目中使用lib，lua的使用同样需要使用lib，除了添加lib，还需要添加lauxlib.h,lua.h，luaconf.h，lualib.h这几个头文件。<br>关于lua的使用，我直接用代码说明吧。<br>以下代码演示了lua的栈操作 ，执行内存脚本，加载脚本中定义的变量，执行脚本中定义的无参函数，执行脚本中定义的有参函数，脚本中调用C++函数等操作。</p>

<p>##制作lib<br>visual studio 新建项目 - win32项目 在应用程序类型选择时使用静态库（dll为动态库），一般情况下不要使用预编译头，像lua这类型的脚本语言，在使用visual studio生成lib的时候是不可以选择使用预编译头的，否则会报错。 在新建项目后，将需要用到的源代码添加到项目后生成即可得到lib文件。<br><em>（建议把项目属性中得输出路径改为.bin，一个你容易找到的目录，这样生成的lib文件就会放入到这个文件夹中了。）</em></p>
<p>##使用lib<br>两种方法：</p>
<ol>
<li>通过修改 项目属性 - 连接器 - 输入 - 附加依赖项去添加lib </li>
<li>加入预编译指令#pragma comment (lib,”*.lib”)，这种方法优点是可以利用条件预编译指令链接不同版本的LIB文件。因为，在Debug方式下，产生的LIB文件是Debug版本，如Regd.lib；在Release方式下，产生的LIB文件是Release版本，如Regr.lib。</li>

</ul>
<p>我们这里主要用递归搜索法进行反汇编。我们分为以下几步：</p>
<h2 id="递归搜索程序入口">递归搜索程序入口</h2><p>既然是递归搜索，首先要有一个起始地址，当然就是程序的入口地址了，这样我们将所有的跳转指令（包括各种跳转、Call、ret）全部算进去，也就是只要遇到可能的跳转我们就要进行一次递归。我们将一段指令（从上一次的跳转到的地址到下一次跳转之前）称为一个指令块。这样我们用递归的方法生成了许多指令块，它们成树形结构。</p>
<h2 id="递归搜索函数">递归搜索函数</h2><p>然而仅仅通过搜索程序的起始地址得到的这个指令块的树并不能构成该程序的所有指令，因为很多函数是系统回调的，比如一个按钮的按下会有一个响应函数，除非你去点击它否则程序不会自己去触发。了解系统原理的都知道，windows有一个消息机制，作为消息响应函数，以及我们实现具体功能的子函数，最初的调用，都在消息响应函数中。而仅仅通过程序的入口，是永远执行不到这里的。很容易理解啊，比如你打开了网游，然后什么也不干，人物不会自动释放技能的。所以我们还需要递归搜索剩下的地址（不包括在树中的）。然后我们其实主要关心函数的调用，而函数的最开始的2条汇编指令是相同的，学过汇编的应该知道就是：push ebp; mov ebp,esp; 于是我们搜索这样的指令，如果找到了，就对每一个这样的函数进行递归，找到一个属于它的树。然后将所有的这些树合并去重。</p>
<h2 id="划分基本块">划分基本块</h2><p>做了以上两步其实已经得到了程序的反汇编了，但是其实还可以更进一步，就是找到程序的基本块，基本块的概念就是程序只有一个入口，切仅有一个出口的一段汇编代码。也就是执行到了第一条指令，中间不会跳转，而且也不会有别的跳转到这个块的中间任何一条指令。《龙书》中有提到这个概念。划分基本块是有必要的，可以进一步对程序进行修改，在这些基本块上的修改，可以保证整个程序的不变性。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>尝试在Ubuntu和Fedora成功配置了Caffe，后来觉得Fedora不好用，就只用ubuntu（没有安装CUDA，因为用的虚拟机嘛）</p>
<p>下面主要说下在Ubuntu14下的配置<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<h2 id="一、安装Caffe">一、安装Caffe</h2><p>安装官网的指引：首先安装依赖包  </p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-<span class="built_in">get</span> install libprotobuf-<span class="built_in">dev</span> libleveldb-<span class="built_in">dev</span> libsnappy-<span class="built_in">dev</span> libopencv-<span class="built_in">dev</span> libboost-<span class="built_in">all</span>-<span class="built_in">dev</span> libhdf5-serial-<span class="built_in">dev</span>
sudo apt-<span class="built_in">get</span> install libgflags-<span class="built_in">dev</span> libgoogle-glog-<span class="built_in">dev</span> liblmdb-<span class="built_in">dev</span> protobuf-compiler
</code></pre><p>因为没有用GPU，用openblas更快，注意安装命令如下</p>
<p>注意该命令官网上没有给出，比较坑，还有如果用默认的ablas好像编译的时候需要手工设置路径而用openblas，在配置文件中是可以通过shall自动定位路径的，这样不容易出错</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-<span class="built_in">get</span> install libopenblas-<span class="built_in">dev</span>
</code></pre><p>然后需要修改Makefile.config</p>
<p>需要设置CPU</p>
<p>设置openblas</p>
<pre><code><span class="keyword">cp</span> Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
# Adjust Makefile.config (<span class="keyword">for</span> example, <span class="keyword">if</span> using Anaconda Python)
<span class="keyword">make</span> <span class="keyword">all</span>
<span class="keyword">make</span> test
<span class="keyword">make</span> runtest
</code></pre><h2 id="二、安装python">二、安装python</h2><p>首先要</p>
<pre><code><span class="built_in">make</span> pycaffe
</code></pre><p>然后使用pip安装所有的依赖库</p>
<p>首先安装pip</p>
<pre><code>#执行前两条就可以了
$ sudo apt-get <span class="operator"><span class="keyword">install</span> python-pip python-dev <span class="keyword">build</span>-essential
$ sudo pip <span class="keyword">install</span> <span class="comment">--upgrade pip</span>
$ sudo pip <span class="keyword">install</span> <span class="comment">--upgrade virtualenv</span></span>
</code></pre><p>所有的依赖项都在 <code>caffe-master/python/requirements.txt</code></p>
<pre><code>sudo pip <span class="keyword">install</span> -r python/requirements.txt
</code></pre><p>啊，是不是速度有点慢？有时候还连接不上。。。换个国内镜像吧，先打开文件 ~/.pip/pip.conf，加入下面内容：</p>
<pre><code>[<span class="keyword">global</span>]
<span class="keyword">index</span>-url = http:<span class="comment">//e.pypi.python.org/simple</span>
</code></pre><p>还有其他源</p>
<pre><code><span class="string">http:</span><span class="comment">//pypi.douban.com/ 豆瓣</span>
<span class="string">http:</span><span class="comment">//pypi.hustunique.com/ 华中理工大学</span>
<span class="string">http:</span><span class="comment">//pypi.sdutlinux.org/ 山东理工大学</span>
<span class="string">http:</span><span class="comment">//pypi.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/ 中国科学技术大学</span>
</code></pre><p>如果想手动指定源，可以在pip后面跟-i 来指定源，比如用豆瓣的源来安装web.py框架：</p>
<pre><code>pip install web<span class="class">.py</span> -<span class="tag">i</span> http:<span class="comment">//pypi.douban.com/simple</span>
</code></pre><p>不过最好还是先翻墙</p>
<ul>
<li>安装过程中好像会出现些小问题，因为scikit会依赖scipy所以可以手动分开安装</li>
<li>注意如果pip编译安装失败，可以先用apt-get命令安装所有编译所需的库</li>
</ul>
<p>我自己用pip安装scipy时出错，后来用apt-get安装了依赖库，下面的库可能有多的<br>    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose</p>
<p>为了让IPython notebook工作，还还需要安装tornado和pyzmq：</p>
<pre><code>sudo pip <span class="operator"><span class="keyword">install</span> tornado
sudo apt-<span class="keyword">get</span> <span class="keyword">install</span> libzmq-dev
sudo pip <span class="keyword">install</span> pyzmq
sudo pip <span class="keyword">install</span> pygments
sudo pip <span class="keyword">install</span> jsonschema
# 其中我系统默认安装了tornado，但是版本低了，需要升级
sudo pip <span class="keyword">install</span> <span class="comment">--upgrade tornado</span></span>
</code></pre><p>下面测试IPython notebook</p>
<pre><code><span class="built_in">cd</span>
<span class="built_in">mkdir</span> notebook
<span class="built_in">cd</span> notebook
ipython notebook
</code></pre><p>看到浏览器启动了</p>
